      <Typography>This is a demo for my imagined way of implementing the game exponential idle.</Typography>
      <Typography>This is a demo! Not all features are implemented and are expected to have bugs.</Typography>
      <Typography>Nothing I made is made to be final and nothing is balanced!</Typography>
      <Typography>THIS IS NOT FINAL IN ANY WAY</Typography>
      <Typography>The code is pretty inconsistent and doesn't follow any rules on how to do things!</Typography>
      <Typography>Do note I am pretty new to react, so some things in the code might be a bit "wanky"!</Typography>
      <Typography>The equations and their code implementations are also probably wrong...</Typography>
